			<!--Paragraph with Embedded Link-->
			<p>My name is Michael, I am from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. After graduating high school, the engineering department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte piqued my interest. In 2007, moving on campus was a major step out of my comfort zone...I have yet to determine whether or not that is good or bad.</p>
		
			<p>I am blessed to have such an amazing support group behind me during the rough times I have endured since moving out on my own. It seems that most of the blessings I have been given, I have squandered. I am ready to make a change in my life, a complete 360. I pray for you, you pray for me, and watch God change things.</p>

			<p>Through all of my hard times, struggles, and pain; self inflicted or not, the one fact that remains the same...</p>

			<p>...it is difficult to succomb to typical when you have witnessed the extraordinary.</p>
		
			<p>Michael J. Sloan</p>
